### Reflections and Comments

This lab went really well, it took me approximately 3 hours to complete, and just had a couple of really basic pieces that would hold up my last two tests. Overall, testing and troubleshooting went well. This is the first lab that I felt I thoroughly understood what the tests and what was being asked.
